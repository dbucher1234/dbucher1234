## Molecules. Models. Coffee. Repeat. 👋

Welcome! I’m a computational scientist who spends most of his time designing molecules, decoding protein pockets, and occasionally training machine learning models.

## 🔧 What I do (mostly)

- 🧬 Molecular design (CADD/ML/FEP)
- 🧠 Properties prediction (targets, ADME/Tox)
- ⚙️ Build tools (with RDKit, OpenFE, AF/Rosetta, Schrödinger, and friends)
- ☁️ Run things at scale (hello AWS and multi-GPU workstations)
