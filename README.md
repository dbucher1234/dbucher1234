## Molecules. Models. Coffee. Repeat. 👋

Welcome! I’m a computational scientist who spends most of his time designing molecules, decoding protein pockets, and occasionally training machine learning models.

---

## 🔧 What I do (mostly)

- 🧬 Molecular design (CADD/ML/FEP)
- 🧠 Properties prediction (targets, ADME/Tox)
- ⚙️ Build tools (with RDKit, OpenFE, Rosetta, Schrödinger, and friends)
- ☁️ Run things at scale (hello AWS and multi-GPU workstations)

## 📂 Featured Repos *(coming soon)*  

- **[FEP toolkit for OpenFE on AWS]**  
  Prep → Run Free energy calcs
- **[MMP analysis scripts]**  
  What makes a molecule better? 
- **[Drug Ideation]**  
  Use Reinvent4 to generate drug-like idea
- **[Protein-ligand docking workflow]** 
  All-in-one sketching to docking to MD equilibration

## 👀 If you're curious...

You can usually find me thinking about:
- How to improve PK without killing activity
- Can free energy methods really help a real-life project
- Whether that ML model will generalize this time
