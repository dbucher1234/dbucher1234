## Molecules. Models. Coffee. Repeat. 👋

Welcome! I’m a computational scientist who spends most of his time designing molecules, decoding protein pockets for hints, and occasionally training machine learning models.

---

## 🔧 What I do (mostly)

- 🧬 Molecular design (CADD/ML/FEP)
- 🧠 Properties prediction (targets, ADME/Tox)
- ⚙️ Build tools (with RDKit, OpenFE, Rosetta, Schrödinger, and friends)
- ☁️ Run things at scale (hello AWS and multi-GPU workstations)

## 📂 Featured Repos *(coming soon)*  

- **[FEP toolkit for OpenFE](https://github.com/dbucher1234/openfe-fep-tools)**  
  Prep → Run → Visualize free energy calcs
- **[MMP analysis scripts](https://github.com/dbucher1234/mmp-analysis)**  
  What makes a molecule better? This might help
- **[Drug-likeness explorer](https://github.com/dbucher1234/druglikeness-notebooks)**  
  Lipinski, logP, PSA—classic but still useful
- **[Protein-ligand docking workflow](https://github.com/dbucher1234/docking-pipeline)** 
  All-in-one docking & visualization setup

## 👀 If you're curious...

You can usually find me thinking about:
- How to improve PK without killing activity
- Can free energy methods really help a real-life project
- Whether that ML model will generalize this time
