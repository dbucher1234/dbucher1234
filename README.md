## Molecules. Models. Coffee. Repeat. 👋

Hi! I’m a computational scientist working at the intersection of molecular design, structural biology, and machine learning.

## 🔧 What I focus on

- 🧬 Designing molecules (CADD, ML, FEP)
- 🧠 Predicting molecular properties (targets, ADME/Tox)
- ⚙️ Building tools with RDKit, OpenFE, AlphaFold/Rosetta, Schrödinger & more
- ☁️ Scaling workflows on multi-GPU systems
